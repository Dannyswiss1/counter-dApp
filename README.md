# Counter dApp
A simple counter dApp that set's count, increment's count and decreament, it implements the require, assert and revert statements respectively, to perform its functions

## Description
CounterdApp is a Solidity smart contract designed to manage a counter value. It provides functions to set, increment, and decrement the counter value, along with error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity.

## Getting Started
### Installing
To use the CounterdApp smart contract, you can copy/clone the provided Solidity code and deploy it on a blockchain network using tools like Remix IDE, Truffle, or Hardhat.

### Executing Program
To interact with the CounterdApp smart contract, you can deploy it on a blockchain network and use Ethereum wallets or other smart contracts to call its functions.

Here's how you can interact with the contract:

Deploy the Contract: Deploy the CounterdApp contract on a blockchain network.
Set Count: Call the setCount function to set the initial count value.
Increment Count: Call the incrementCount function to increase the count by a specified amount.
Decrement Count: Call the decrementValue function to decrease the count by a specified amount.
